# Develop

To work with IRB Rocks! theme you will need to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/).

After install base dependencies, clone the repository and run `npm install` to download development dependencies:

	git clone https://github.com/irbrocks/theme.git

All changes must be performed on `assets/sass`, because `assets/css` folder are generated automatically with Gulp.
